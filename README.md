## Quick Install
1. Download the `.zip` from [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/your-addon).
2. In Blender: `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...`
3. Select the `.zip` and enable **Road Tools**.

## Setup

### Add Road Object
To get started creating your roads, in the 3d-viewport open the `N` Panel, click the `Road Tools` Subpanel and press the `Add new road object` button. This appends the default road object along with it's assets. 

### Presets
this panel let's you load and save road presets. <br>
The addon comes with a few premade presets. In edit mode, select the edges you want to apply the preset to and pick one from the dropdown menu. If the preset doesn't load automatically, press the `load` button. 

#### Preset customisation
Whilst in edit mode, a subpanel `customise road` is available. Opening it reveals ways in which you can customise the selected road edges.

> **Note:** Customising the road edges does not change the whole preset itself, it only updates attributes for the selection

To apply the customisations, press the `Apply Customisations` button. 
To make the customisation more responsive, you can use the `live toggle update` button (a white circle to the left of the `Apply Customisations` button).  
The `live toggle update` lets you apply the changes live to the selected edges without the need to press the `Apply Customisations` button, however it leaves all the customisation menus visible, regardles if they will work for the selected road type. 

#### Save custom presets.
